# PDF Decryptor

## What is this?

The tool is only effective if all the PDFs have the same password.

I had around 50 pdfs that I have to open with a password, I want to store them, but I have the risk to forget the password to open them, so I just want to remove the password. I can do that in the classic
way and just open the PDF and saving without the password, but that means I need to make the same action a lot of times, and I don't like it, I preferred the option of making this small tool.

## Usage

Change the variables in the Program.cs file, and run it.
